Instead of having 2 difficulty values for a user to mine in the Tx-PoW, the Transaction Difficulty set to 10 seconds of work on average, and the Block Difficulty set to 1 block every 10 seconds, let us add 1 more difficulty, the Super Block Difficulty set to twice the current block difficulty...","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"minimawhitepaper/abstract":{"id":"minimawhitepaper/abstract","title":"Abstract","description":"The Evolution will not be Centralized","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"minimawhitepaper/blocksize":{"id":"minimawhitepaper/blocksize","title":"Block Size","description":"Blocks in Minima are small. As small as a transaction. All transactions are potential blocks. Blocks are just lucky transactions. Blocks only contain references to transactions (Compact blocks in Bitcoin), that have already been sent across the network, rather than the entire transaction. Minima also uses an adaptive block size. The maximum size is set by the chain as twice the average block size of the last n blocks. This allows the users themselves to determine the block size. By filling their blocks higher than the average they will make the maximum size greater, by filling them lower, the maximum will be made lower. Users can drag the maximum block size up or down depending on whether they need it, or whether enough traffic is going Lightning[3] and beyond.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"minimawhitepaper/blockspeed":{"id":"minimawhitepaper/blockspeed","title":"Block Speed","description":"The security of a transaction is not improved by a faster block speed, since the amount of security is a function of the cumulative PoW of the parent blocks (hash-rates being equal 1 BTC block is worth 4 LTC blocks, since LTC runs 4x faster). A faster chain does increase the granularity of information[6] and allows a user to know sooner when their transaction is secure enough.

This is because there are 2 types of \u2018full\u2019 user. The first helps in the construction and validation of the chain - Complete nodes (the miners). The second only helps in the validation of the chain - Full nodes (the validators).

Sending millions of emails \u2018costs\u2019 nothing \u2013 hardware, processing, bandwidth, etc. A lone computer sitting on the internet can send millions of emails in almost no time, constantly. HashCash enforced that a PoW payment was included whenever an email was sent. To a single user sending emails every few minutes, this was utterly negligible, a background process that hummed for a few seconds after you press the \u2018Send\u2019 button.

What if sending a message is time-critical, and there must be no delay before sending it \u2013 say a high-frequency trader? Maxima addresses both these concerns by repurposing existing technology, allowing users to do the work beforehand, and then present that work as proof when sending messages.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"minimawhitepaper/txpow":{"id":"minimawhitepaper/txpow","title":"Tx-PoW","description":"Removing the miners requires the users themselves to secure the chain.

Unlike Minima, IOTA does not use a blockchain, instead, opting for a transaction DAG or Tangle. Whether the Tangle can converge in a decentralized fashion is still a topic of debate and recently IOTA switched to a new system, in an attempt to rectify their current solution, a centralized checkpoint server.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"runanode/android_v9_and_up":{"id":"runanode/android_v9_and_up","title":"Android v9 and up","description":"Videos","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"runanode/get_started_in_3_steps":{"id":"runanode/get_started_in_3_steps","title":"Get started in 3 steps","description":"Running a Minima node couldn\'t be easier, and if you choose to join our Incentive Program, you will earn 1 Reward each day your node is live!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"runanode/linux_desktop":{"id":"runanode/linux_desktop","title":"Linux Desktop","description":"How to download and Install Minima on your Linux Desktop","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"runanode/linux_vps":{"id":"runanode/linux_vps","title":"Linux VPS","description":"How to download and Install Minima on your Linux Server/Desktop (Debian OS including Ubuntu)","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"runanode/mac":{"id":"runanode/mac","title":"Mac","description":"How to download and Install Minima on your Mac","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"runanode/windows":{"id":"runanode/windows","title":"Windows","description":"How to download and Install Minima on your Windows PC","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tokendistribution":{"id":"tokendistribution","title":"Token Distribution","description":"The total supply of Minima tokens is fixed and pre-allocated.
